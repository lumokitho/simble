# simble

A *node.js* module for **sim**ple access to **ble** (Bluetooth Low Energy = Bluetooth 4.x) devices.

This module is a wrapper for sandeepmistry's great [*noble*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noble) package, using Promises instead of callbacks and providing a somewhat different API.

Unfortunately, the API is not documented yet, so there's very little reason for others to use it yet. I published it because another Node.js module of mine requires it.
